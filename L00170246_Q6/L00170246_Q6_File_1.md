<!-- ABOUT THE TASK -->
## About The Task

Write a Terraform Script to create a sample infrastructure in the public cloud on
AWS. Follow the diagram provided on BB. Upload the script to your Repo.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Set up your system

I used a virtual machine running Ubuntu 20.4 and the terminal to run this part of the assignment.

## Tasks

### Step 1

I validated my connection to Amazon Web Services (AWS) using the command:





```sh
  aws configure
   ```
From this command I am prompted to add the following details:
```sh
  AWS Access Key ID [****************PIXE]: 
  AWS Secret Access Key [****************lioS]: 
  Default region name [eu-west-1]: 
  Default output format [None]: 
   ```

These details are available to the user from the Identity and Access Management module of the AWS account. (Warning: it is important to be careful with you Secret Access ID & Secret Access Key )



### Step 2

Inside my Folder L00170246_Q6, I create a file called 'main.tf'

Inside the main.tf file, we produce the following code as per figure 1 below. This code comes from the demo on tha Hashicorp
Website.

Figure 1


### Step 3

Now that the terraform configuration file is created run init to initialize terraform using the command:
```sh
  terraform init
   ```

   [![](/Users/pierceoneill/Desktop/OOPR_Assignment_DCM2021/L00170246_Q6/Screenshots/L00170246_Q6_img02.png)]()
Figure 2

As can be seen from Figure 2, Terraform has been successfully initialized!

### Step 4

To run the file we need to run the command
```sh
  terraform fmt
   ```
which should return 'main.tf' and also the command
```sh
  terraform fmt
   ```
which should produce the success message as per figure 3 below

   [![](/Users/pierceoneill/Desktop/OOPR_Assignment_DCM2021/L00170246_Q6/Screenshots/L00170246_Q6_img03.png)]()

Figure 3

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Step 5

When we run the commands above, we should be able to see our EC-2 instance created in AWS as per 
figure 4 below


   [![](/Users/pierceoneill/Desktop/OOPR_Assignment_DCM2021/L00170246_Q6/Screenshots/L00170246_Q6_img04.png)]()

Figure 4

### Step 6

To test the settings inside terraform, we are going to modify the settings inside the 'main.tf' file. We are going to change the version 
of Linux used by changing the ami from

```sh
  ami = "ami-830c94e3"
   ```
to

```sh
  ami = "ami-08d70e59c07c61a3a"
   ```

We must use the commands 

```sh
  terraform validate
   ```


```sh
  terraform plan
   ```
to ensure the code is still valid and to describe the tasks to be carried out. By running 
```sh
  terraform apply
   ```
we enact this plan and if refresh the AWS EC-2 dashboard, our 1st instance 'i-03609720cbce77c1' is shut down and terminates. Our new Instance 'i-030e6c4e80162c700' starts with our new ami id 'ami-08d70e59c07c61a3a'

Figure 5

### Step 6

By running the command


```sh
  terraform destroy
   ```
we will destroy all resources managed by terraform for a give project.

   [![](/Users/pierceoneill/Desktop/OOPR_Assignment_DCM2021/L00170246_Q6/Screenshots/L00170246_Q6_img06.png)]()

Figure 6

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Step 7

In this example we take the variable from another
file as needed an populate the variables file for use by terraform. This way we can keep the file
secret or we can modify the contents of the file as often as needed. The variables held in the terraform.tfvars therefore populate the variables.tf which then go into the
main.tf file.

Variables.tf might show details such as the type and description even if the value is not provided.
```sh
variable “aws_secret_key” {
 type = string
 description = “Secret key for authorization”
}
 ```

We can run terraform graph to get a summarized, graphic version of the steps to be carried out.

```sh
terraform graph
 ```
This produces the below output, figure 7 from our Instance 

   [![](/Users/pierceoneill/Desktop/OOPR_Assignment_DCM2021/L00170246_Q6/Screenshots/L00170246_Q6_img07.png)]()


Figure 7

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Step 8

The value of fields from a plugin can be stored in a similar way to the varaibles.tf file. In this example
two values are stored. When we originally apply a change to our resource the following output is
shown below. A simple ‘apply complete’ is indicated.

However, the aws provider has access to additional information. To access it we can create a file to
convert the values for use by terraform.

We create a file to convert the values for storage called outputs.tf
```sh
output "instance_id" {
description = "ID of the EC2 instance"
value = aws_instance.app_server.id
}
output "instance_public_ip" {
description = "Public IP address of the EC2 instance"
value = aws_instance.app_server.public_ip
}
```

### Step 9

To tidy up and finish our lab we must use the command

```sh
   terraform destroy
   ```
