<!-- ABOUT THE TASK -->
## About The Task

Write a Python script to determine which ports are open and display the
information in a tidy format. 

Where port 22 is shown as open display the word
“SSH” where port 80 is shown as open display the word “HTTP”. 

Take screenshots of the code running on your system. Save them to a file named
L0012345_Q4_File_1 where L0012345

is replace by your own L number. 

Save the
script as L0012345_Q4_File_2

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Set up your system

I am going to be using the VM running Ubuntu 20.04 and using PyCharm on a Macbook to prepare the script.
## Tasks

### Step 1

To identify the I.P. address of the Apache2 website we run the command in the terminal:

```sh
  ifconfig
   ```
We are returned a list of the of running I.P.'s Once we returned we then need to see if the ports are open.

To do this we run:
```sh
  netstat
   ```
However this returns a long list of all ports. To simplify it, we can search for just the listening  ports by returning

the command. To do this we run:
```sh
  netstat -tulpn 
   ```

### Step 2

We have been tasked with connecting to the virtual machine using a python script.

We construct the python script in Pycharm as per figure 2 below.

### Step 3

To run the script in PyCharm we use the command:

```sh
   python3 L00170264_Q4_File02.py
   ```

Figure 3

As can be seen from Figure 3, ```SSH:22 is open``` &  ```HTTP:80 is open```
