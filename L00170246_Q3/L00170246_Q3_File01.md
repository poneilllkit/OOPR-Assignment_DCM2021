<!-- ABOUT THE TASK -->
## About The Task

Connect to the virtual machine using a python script using the ssh port via
modifying a previous script from the ‘Networking Labs’. 

Establish that the connection was successful. Use screenshots to demonstrate that this worked. 

Save
them to a file named L0012345_Q1_File_1 where L0012345 is replaced by your own
L number.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Set up your system

I am using a Macbook, so I decided to use Iterm to establish a connection to the virtual machine

## Tasks

### Step 1

To test the connection to the VM from my host I use Iterm with the following command:

```sh
  ssh l00170246@172.16.88.129
   ```
This includes my username "l00170246" & VM web hosting ip address "172.16.88.29"

Figure 1

The terminal then asks me to continue using ECDSA key & password as show in Figure 1 above. On entering the password for the VM machine, I succesfully connect.
### Step 2

We have been tasked with connecting to the virtual machine using a python script.

We construct the python script in Pycharm as per figure 2 below.

Figure 2

To execute the script we return the command:
   ```sh
   python3 L00170246_Q3_File02.py  
   ```

This returns the statement:

```sh
   Connected to: 172.16.88.129 
   ```


### Step 3

I have opted to show what happens if the password is incorrect when running the script.

I have changed the password from ```Wms0Fri2021!  ``` to ```Wms0Fri2022!```

Figure 3

As can be seen from Figure 3, the connection has failed 

```sh
   Authentication Failed 
   ```
