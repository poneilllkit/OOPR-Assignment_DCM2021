<!-- ABOUT THE ASSESSMENT -->
## About The Assessment

In this continuous assessment for Objected Orientated Programming for Server Administration, we had six tasks to carry out in our Programming Assignment.
The details of all the files and documentation can be found on Github at [OOPR-Assignment_DCM2021](https://github.com/poneilllkit/OOPR-Assignment_DCM2021)

## Task 01 - Labelled as L00170246_Q1

Task1 was a straightforward task, going through thr motions of installing Apache2 on the VM with Ubuntu 20.4 we were using for this
assignment. I used my college account ID L00170246 to create account, and ran the command 'sudo apt-get install apache2' followed by 'sudo ufw allow 'Apache Full'. 

By running 'sudo start apache2' and the 'sudo restart apache2'  we can see the status of our website we have created by running 'sudo systemctl status apache' we can see 
the details of our webpage as per figure 1 below.

To see what IP address our webpage is running on we can run 'ip addr show' which will reveal the address which in this case is '172.16.88.129' as shown below in figure 2:

### Task 02 - Labelled as L00170246_Q2

In the task 2, we were challenged with scraping the apache web page we created or the Letterkenny IT page. On this occasion I chose the LKIT website, [Letterkenny I.T.](https://www.lyit.ie). 

As I have used the Beautifulsoup module before, I decided to try out Scrapy for this task. The module was very easy to install using the command    
```sh
   pip install scrapy
   ``` 
Scrapy is an application framework for writing web spiders that crawl web sites and extract data from them. Using scrapy we generate spiders which can be setup and run to pull information. My file L00170246_Q2_File01.py, below in figure 3, shows an example which pulls "h3" elements from the website.

### Task 03 - Labelled as L00170246_Q3

In Task 03, we have been asked to our virtual machine using a python script using the ssh port via
modifying a previous script and verify that the connection was successful.  

To test the connection to the VM from my host I used Iterm on my Mac OSX with the following command:

```sh
  ssh l00170246@172.16.88.129
   ```
This includes my username "l00170246" & VM web hosting ip address "172.16.88.29"

I constructed the python script in Pycharm as per figure 4 below.

Figure 4

To prove that the connection will not work with the wrong security credentials, I updated the password and it produced the error

```sh
   Authentication Failed 
   ```
