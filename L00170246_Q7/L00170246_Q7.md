## About The Assessment <div id="about"></div>

In this continuous assessment for Objected Orientated Programming for Server Administration, we had six tasks to carry out in our Programming Assignment.
The details of all the files and documentation can be found on Github at [OOPR-Assignment_DCM2021](https://github.com/poneilllkit/OOPR-Assignment_DCM2021)

## Task 01 - Labelled as L00170246_Q1

Task1 was a straightforward task, going through thr motions of installing Apache2 on the VM with Ubuntu 20.4 we were using for this
assignment. I used my college account ID L00170246 to create account, and ran the command 'sudo apt-get install apache2' followed by 'sudo ufw allow 'Apache Full'. 

By running 'sudo start apache2' and the 'sudo restart apache2'  we can see the status of our website we have created by running 'sudo systemctl status apache' we can see 
the details of our webpage as per figure 1 below.

Figure 1

To see what IP address our webpage is running on we can run 'ip addr show' which will reveal the address which in this case is '172.16.88.129' as shown below in figure 2:

## Task 02 - Labelled as L00170246_Q2 <div id="task02"></div>

In the task 2, we were challenged with scraping the apache web page we created or the Letterkenny IT page. On this occasion I chose the LKIT website, [Letterkenny I.T.](https://www.lyit.ie). 

As I have used the Beautifulsoup module before, I decided to try out Scrapy for this task. The module was very easy to install using the command    
```sh
   pip install scrapy
   ``` 
Scrapy is an application framework for writing web spiders that crawl web sites and extract data from them. Using scrapy we generate spiders which can be setup and run to pull information. My file L00170246_Q2_File01.py, below in figure 3, shows an example which pulls "h3" elements from the website.

## Task 03 - Labelled as L00170246_Q3 <div id="task03"></div>

In Task 03, we have been asked to our virtual machine using a python script using the ssh port via
modifying a previous script and verify that the connection was successful.  

To test the connection to the VM from my host I used Iterm on my Mac OSX with the following command:

```sh
  ssh l00170246@172.16.88.129
   ```
This includes my username "l00170246" & VM web hosting ip address "172.16.88.29"

I constructed the python script in Pycharm as per figure 4 below.

Figure 4

To prove that the connection will not work with the wrong security credentials, I updated the password and it produced the error

```sh
   Authentication Failed 
   ```
This task was interesting using python to form the script. I have enjoyed learning python and its light but powerful code.

## Task 04 - Labelled as L00170246_Q4 <div id="task04"></div>

Similar to the previous task, we had to create a python script but this time to determine which ports are open, in particular Port 22 &  Port 80. 

I constructed the python script in Pycharm as per figure 5, modifying the code from our lab with Ruth Lennon LYIT.

Figure 5

The script checks the posts in range from 21 to 81 and checks if port 22 or port 80 are open using the 'elif' statement which is pythons short form for 'else if'
. This means the script checks for open ports on 22 or 80 and returns a message to confirm the status as per figure 6.

## Task 05 - Labelled as L00170246_Q5 <div id="task05"></div>

In task 5, code was provided which had to be modified in such a way as to (1) install curl, (2) create a directory structure & (3) find out when files were last accessed.
To install curl, I reopened the VM and ran the command:



```sh
  sudo apt install curl 
   ```

curl installs successfully as per figure 1 below.

Figure 7

We construct the python script in Pycharm as per figure 8 below.

Figure 8

As can be seen from Figure 2, the script has created the Folder Labs with Lab1 & Lab2

By running the command 
```sh
ls -l --time=atime
```

We can see a list of the directories and the last time they were accessed in figure 9 below:

## Task 06 - Labelled as L00170246_Q6 <div id="task06"></div>

In task 6, we were asked to construct a Terraform Script to create a sample infrastructure in Amazon Web Services. I used a virtual machine running Ubuntu 20.4 and the terminal to run this part of the assignment.

I validated my connection to Amazon Web Services (AWS) using the command:





```sh
  aws configure
   ```
From this command I am prompted to add the following details:
```sh
  AWS Access Key ID [****************PIXE]: 
  AWS Secret Access Key [****************lioS]: 
  Default region name [eu-west-1]: 
  Default output format [None]: 
   ```

These details are available to the user from the Identity and Access Management module of the AWS account. (Warning: it is important to be careful with you Secret Access ID & Secret Access Key )

Inside my Folder L00170246_Q6, I create a file called 'main.tf'

Inside the main.tf file, we produce the following code as per figure 10 below. This code comes from the demo on tha Hashicorp
Website.

Figure 10

Now that the terraform configuration file is created run init to initialize terraform using the command:
```sh
  terraform init
   ```

   [![](/Users/pierceoneill/Desktop/OOPR_Assignment_DCM2021/L00170246_Q6/Screenshots/L00170246_Q6_img02.png)]()

Figure 11

As can be seen from Figure 11, Terraform has been successfully initialized!
`

To run the file we need to run the command
```sh
  terraform fmt
   ```
which should return 'main.tf' and also the command
```sh
  terraform fmt
   ```
which should produce the success message as per figure 12 below

   [![](/Users/pierceoneill/Desktop/OOPR_Assignment_DCM2021/L00170246_Q6/Screenshots/L00170246_Q6_img03.png)]()

Figure 12

When we run the commands above, we should be able to see our EC-2 instance created in AWS as per 
figure 13 below


   [![](/Users/pierceoneill/Desktop/OOPR_Assignment_DCM2021/L00170246_Q6/Screenshots/L00170246_Q6_img04.png)]()

Figure 13

To test the settings inside terraform, we are going to modify the settings inside the 'main.tf' file. We are going to change the version 
of Linux used by changing the ami from

```sh
  ami = "ami-830c94e3"
   ```
to

```sh
  ami = "ami-08d70e59c07c61a3a"
   ```

We must use the commands 

```sh
  terraform validate
   ```


```sh
  terraform plan
   ```
to ensure the code is still valid and to describe the tasks to be carried out. By running 
```sh
  terraform apply
   ```
we enact this plan and if refresh the AWS EC-2 dashboard, our 1st instance 'i-03609720cbce77c1' is shut down and terminates. Our new Instance 'i-030e6c4e80162c700' starts with our new ami id 'ami-08d70e59c07c61a3a'

   [![](/Users/pierceoneill/Desktop/OOPR_Assignment_DCM2021/L00170246_Q6/Screenshots/L00170246_Q6_img05.png)]()

Figure 14

By running the command


```sh
  terraform destroy
   ```
we will destroy all resources managed by terraform for a give project.

   [![](/Users/pierceoneill/Desktop/OOPR_Assignment_DCM2021/L00170246_Q6/Screenshots/L00170246_Q6_img06.png)]()

Figure 15


In this example we take the variable from another
file as needed an populate the variables file for use by terraform. This way we can keep the file
secret or we can modify the contents of the file as often as needed. The variables held in the terraform.tfvars therefore populate the variables.tf which then go into the
main.tf file.

Variables.tf might show details such as the type and description even if the value is not provided.
```sh
variable “aws_secret_key” {
 type = string
 description = “Secret key for authorization”
}
 ```

We can run terraform graph to get a summarized, graphic version of the steps to be carried out.

```sh
terraform graph
 ```
This produces the below output, figure 16 from our Instance 

   [![](/Users/pierceoneill/Desktop/OOPR_Assignment_DCM2021/L00170246_Q6/Screenshots/L00170246_Q6_img07.png)]()


Figure 16

The value of fields from a plugin can be stored in a similar way to the variables.tf file. In this example
two values are stored. When we originally apply a change to our resource the following output is
shown below. A simple ‘apply complete’ is indicated.

However, the aws provider has access to additional information. To access it we can create a file to
convert the values for use by terraform.

We create a file to convert the values for storage called outputs.tf
```sh
output "instance_id" {
description = "ID of the EC2 instance"
value = aws_instance.app_server.id
}
output "instance_public_ip" {
description = "Public IP address of the EC2 instance"
value = aws_instance.app_server.public_ip
}
```


To tidy up and finish our lab we must use the command

```sh
   terraform destroy
   ```

## Conclusion  <div id="conclusion"></div>

I found this assessment challenging, but I also learned a lot by using python scripts to automate tasks. It was very satisfying to get the end results and to be able to unserstand how and where they came from.

The final task with terraform was new to me. I have experience with AWS but not this area. I feel that what I learned will help me with my career and studies. I will need to study Terraform more, however I found it a very "user-friendly" to understand. 
Task 6 probably took me the most amount of time to finish. Going through each task for the first time and learning was enjoyable.

I really enjoyed the coding side of this project being able to use short concise bits of code to produce an end result. I used Git and committed as best I could. I did have an issue with my computer after completing the first 5 tasks but resolved it. I enjoy finding solutions to problems and also like the backup of Git and Github.
